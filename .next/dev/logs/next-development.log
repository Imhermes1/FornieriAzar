[00:00:00.908] Server  ERROR   (node:16646) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/lukefornieri/Fornieri%20&%20Azar%20Website/next.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/lukefornieri/Fornieri & Azar Website/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
